# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

This repository contains a driver drowsiness detection system that uses computer vision techniques to monitor a driver's level of alertness. The system analyzes real-time video input from a camera which can be placed inside a vehicle and alerts the driver if signs of drowsiness are detected, helping to prevent potential accidents caused by driver fatigue.

The project utilizes OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, to perform facial landmark detection and eye aspect ratio (EAR) calculation. By tracking the driver's eyes, the system can determine if the eyes are closed for an extended period, indicating drowsiness. When drowsiness is detected, an alarm is triggered to alert the driver, allowing them to take necessary measures to stay awake and focused.
